  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Last updated: November 2025</p>

  <p>Aliwan Dev (“we”, “our”, or “us”) operates as an independent developer creating simple, privacy-respecting mobile applications.  
  This Privacy Policy describes how we handle data and protect your privacy when you use our apps.</p>

  <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
  <p>Our applications are designed to function without collecting or storing personally identifiable information.  
  We do not require user accounts, do not track usage behavior, and do not sell any user data.</p>

  <h2>Permissions</h2>
  <p>Some apps may request specific permissions such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Camera:</strong> Used only for scanning QR or barcodes. The camera feed is processed locally on your device and never stored or transmitted.</li>
    <li><strong>Storage (optional):</strong> Used to read or save locally generated data, such as history logs or user notes, which remain on your device.</li>
    <li><strong>Internet:</strong> Used only if the app requires online content or updates. No personal information is sent or shared.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>Some apps may include third-party components (for example, libraries or SDKs) that may collect limited, non-identifiable information for functionality or analytics purposes.  
  Please review their respective privacy policies when applicable.</p>

  <h2>Data Security</h2>
  <p>We take your privacy seriously and implement design decisions that keep your data private by default.  
  All user-related data, such as scan history or notes, are stored locally on your device and can be deleted at any time by clearing the app data.</p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>Our applications are not designed for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from minors.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated “Last updated” date.</p>
