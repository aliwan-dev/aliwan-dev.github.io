    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="meta">Effective date: <strong>December 6, 2025</strong></p>

    <p>Thank you for using <strong>Sudoku (Lite)</strong> (the "App"). This Privacy Policy explains what information the App may collect, how that information is used, and the choices you have. By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <h3>1.1 Information You Provide</h3>
    <p>We do not require you to create an account or sign in to use the App. You are not required to provide personal information to play Sudoku (Lite). If you contact us (for support, feedback, or otherwise), you may optionally provide an email address or other contact information — this information will only be used to respond to your message.</p>

    <h3>1.2 Automatically Collected Information</h3>
    <p>The App may automatically collect certain non-personal information when you use it, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Device information (device model, operating system version, screen size);</li>
      <li>App usage data (e.g., which screens you visit, game sessions, feature usage);</li>
      <li>Crash reports and diagnostics to help us improve stability.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.3 Analytics and Third-Party Services</h3>
    <p>We may use third-party analytics services (such as Google Analytics for Firebase or similar) to analyze usage patterns and improve the App. These services may collect device identifiers and usage information. For more details about how these third parties handle data, please consult their privacy policies.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To operate, maintain and improve the App's features and performance;</li>
      <li>To provide customer support and respond to user inquiries;</li>
      <li>To diagnose and fix technical issues and crashes;</li>
      <li>To analyze usage and optimize the user experience.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Ads and Monetization</h2>
    <p>The current Lite version of the App is a simple Sudoku game and does not display personalized advertising. If we add ads or monetization features in the future, we will disclose the types of ads and any data sharing with ad networks in an updated privacy policy.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>We do not sell personal information. We may share non-personal aggregated or anonymized data with service providers to help operate and improve the App. We may also disclose information if required by law or to protect the rights and safety of users or others.</p>

    <h2>5. International Data Transfers</h2>
    <p>If you use the App from outside the developer's country, please note that information (including analytics or crash reports) may be transferred to and processed in the developer's country. By using the App, you consent to such transfers.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain analytics and crash data for as long as necessary to provide the App and to comply with legal obligations. If you contact us and provide contact information, we will retain that information only as long as needed to respond to your request.</p>

    <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child provided us with personal information, please contact us and we will take steps to delete that information.</p>

    <h2>8. Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable measures to protect information collected through the App. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is completely secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h2>9. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
    <p>You may choose not to provide certain information, but this may limit your ability to use some features. To opt-out of analytics collection where supported, you can disable analytics/data collection in your device settings if that option is provided by the analytics provider or uninstall the App.</p>

    <h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When changes are made, we will update the "Effective date" at the top of this page. Continued use of the App after a change indicates your acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
