      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="muted">Last updated: November 21, 2025</p>
      <p class="small">This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>Simple Number Match</strong> ("we", "us" or "the App") collects, uses, and discloses your information when you use our mobile application.</p>
    </header>

    <section>
      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>We strive to minimize the personal information we collect. When you use Simple Number Match, we may collect:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Usage data:</strong> Non-personal information about how you interact with the app (e.g., screens viewed, session duration, scores and leaderboard data).</li>
        <li><strong>Device information:</strong> Device model, operating system version, and language settings. This information helps us improve compatibility and performance.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="muted">We do not collect your name, email address, or other personal identifiers unless you voluntarily provide them to contact support.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>2. Leaderboard and Scores</h2>
      <p>The app includes a simple leaderboard that stores high scores to show the top five scorers. Scores saved to the leaderboard do not include personally-identifying information by default — only the score value and any optional display name you choose to provide. If you opt to enter a display name, it may appear on the leaderboard for other users to see.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
      <p>We use the collected information to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Display and maintain the leaderboard and your game progress.</li>
        <li>Understand usage patterns and improve the app’s performance and features.</li>
        <li>Diagnose and fix technical issues.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4. Data Storage & Security</h2>
      <p>Score data and local settings are stored on the device (local storage or shared preferences). We take reasonable measures to protect stored data, but no method of storage or transmission over the internet is 100% secure.</p>
      <p class="muted">If the app offers any remote or cloud-synced features in the future, those will be described in an updated policy and implement appropriate security controls.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>We may use third-party analytics or crash reporting services to help us understand app usage and stability. These services may collect device and usage information in an anonymized or aggregated form. We do not control the privacy practices of third-party providers — please review their privacy policies for more details.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>6. Advertising & Tracking</h2>
      <p>Simple Number Match is designed primarily as a lightweight casual game. If the app displays ads or uses advertising SDKs, those third parties may collect information about your device and app usage to serve and measure ads. Advertisers may use cookies or similar technologies. We do not share more personal information than necessary for these services to function.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>7. Children</h2>
      <p>Our app is suitable for general audiences. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If you believe we have inadvertently collected personal data from a child, please contact us and we will take steps to delete such data.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>8. Your Choices</h2>
      <p>You can choose not to provide optional display names for the leaderboard or opt out of certain analytics if such settings are offered in the app. To remove local data (scores and preferences), uninstalling the app or clearing app data will typically erase local storage.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. If we make material changes, we will post the updated policy here with a revised "Last updated" date.</p>
